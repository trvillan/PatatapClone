If you want to get rid of the Cross Origin errors in the console, you'll need to run a local HTTP server from your project's 
directory and load the circles.html file from there. The steps are as follows:

1) navigate to your project folder in the terminal

2) if you have python v2.x installed then run: 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
 
or for python v3.x:

python -m http.server

3) open up your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

4) select the circles.html file
